## **1 What Should Be Tested?**
### Penetration Testing Types

* Software (Operating system, services, application)
* Hardware
* Network
* Processes
* End-user behavior

# 1 Social Engineering Test
  These tests are mostly done through phone or internet and it targets certain helpdesks, employees & processes.

# 2 Web Application Test
  Using software methods one can verify if the application is exposed to security vulnerabilities. 
  It checks the security vulnerability of web apps and software programs positioned in the target environment.

# 3 Physical Penetration Test 
  All physical network devices and access points are tested for the possibilities of any security breach. 

# 4 Network Services Test
  The openings in the network are identified by which entry is being made in the systems on the network to check what kind of vulnerabilities are there.
  
# 5 Client-side Test
  It aims to search and exploit vulnerabilities in client-side software programs
  
# 6 Remote dial-up war dial
  It searches for modems in the environment and tries to log in to the systems connected through these modems by password guessing or brute-forcing

# 7 Wireless Security Test
  It discovers the open, unauthorized and less secured hotspots or Wi-Fi networks and connects through them


## **2 Pen Testing Approaches, Techniques and Tools**

### Approaches

* **Black Box** Penetration Testing 
In this approach, the tester assesses the target system, network or process without the knowledge of its details. 

* **White Box** Penetration Testing
In this approach, the tester is equipped with complete details about the target environment 

* **Grey** Box Penetration Testing
In this approach, the tester has limited details about the target environment

### Techniques
* **Manual** Penetration Test
* Using **automated** penetration test tools
* Combination of **both manual and automated** process

The third process is more common to identify all kinds of vulnerabilities

### Tools
Why choose free pentesting tools? Because commercial tools are expensive

* **nmap**      network scanning 
* **tcpdump**   network scanning
* **wireshark** network protocol analyzer    

* **owasp-zap**  finds vulnerabilities in web applications
* **w3af**  a web application attack and audit framework 

* **Hydra**  online brute-forcing of passwords
* **Jack the Ripper**  offline brute-forcing of passwords

* **Sqlmap**       exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities
* **Metasploit**   exploitation framework tool

* **Kali Linux**  Advanced Penetration Testing Distribution
* **Spiderfoot**  Gathers information from every single place of data available on the web on different services, networks, and protocols... and one at the time becomes a pretty time-consuming task

* **Lynis** only Linux - Security Auditing, Compliance Testing & System Hardening Tools

## **3 The Pentesting Cycle**
There are five basic stages in a pentest cycle: 

### 1 Information gathering  
* In this stage so as much information is gathered as possible about your WEB APPLICATION. Network ports and map its architecture are scanned. If social engineering attacks are planned  information about system users are gatherd.  

### 2 Scanning  
* This stage uses the information gathered in stage one to look for vulnerabilities like outdated software, weak passwords, and XSS errors. 

### 3 Exploitation 
* Having ascertained the weaknesses in the target, now is the time to take control and launch a few exploits. At this stage,  the true nature of your WEB APPLICATION is exploried. You want to see how they react to an attack. You know that if you play your cards right, youâ€™ll gain more than a few database records. 

### 4 Maintaining access 
* One of the goals is to mimic advanced persistent threats (APT), those that can lay dormant in a system for years before launching an attack. In this stage a place to hide backdoors and rootkits to allow easy future access is to be found and to spy on your Web Application.

### 5 Assessment and cover up 
* The results are analyzed and a risk assessment report is created for your organization.
